\section{Equipment}
The experimental setup consists of the following components:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Breadboard: 
        Used to connect the components together.

    \item Resistors
    
    \item BJTs: Bipolar Junction Transistors
    
    \item LEDs: Light Emitting Diodes
       
    
    \item Power supplies: 
        Provide the necessary voltage levels for the op-amp operation.
    
    \item Signal generator: 
        Provides the input voltage signal for differentiation.
    
    \item Oscilloscope: 
        Used to measure and visualize the input and output waveforms.

\end{enumerate}
