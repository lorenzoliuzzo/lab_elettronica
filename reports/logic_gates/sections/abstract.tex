In the realm of modern electronics, logic gates serve as the basic building blocks that underpin the entire digital landscape. 
Composed of transistors and various electronic components, logic gates enable the manipulation and processing of binary information, the driving force behind computers, smartphones, and numerous other digital systems. \\
This report embarks on a journey to unveil the principles governing logic gates, their operations, and practical applications. 
The various types of logic gates — NOT, NAND, NOR, AND, OR, and XOR — will be explored, each characterized by its distinct behavior and role within digital circuits.
