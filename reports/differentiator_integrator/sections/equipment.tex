\section{Equipment}
The experimental setup consists of the following components:

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item \emph{Bread-board}
	\item Probe and coaxial cables
    \item BNC T-splitter
	\item Resistor (\SI{9.94}{\kilo\ohm})
	\item Capacitor (\SI{2.27}{\nano\farad})
    \item Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp uA741): used to amplify the voltage difference between its input terminals.    
    \item Power supplies: provide the necessary voltage levels for the Op-Amp.
    \item Signal generator Agilent 33220A: provides the input voltage signal.
    \item Oscilloscope Tektronix TDS2012C: used to measure and visualize the input and output waveforms and their time shift.

\end{itemize}
