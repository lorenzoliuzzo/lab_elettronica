In the realm of electronics and signal processing, a profound understanding of circuit behavior is paramount for designing high-efficiency systems. 
The primary objective of this experiment was to delve into the intricacies of differentiator and integrator circuits, shedding light on their gain and phase responses across a wide range of frequencies. 
To achieve this, custom-tailored circuits were meticulously constructed to fulfill the distinct roles of measuring rate of change and cumulative input. 
Through comprehensive frequency sweeps that encompassed a spectrum from low to high frequencies, intricate data regarding gain and phase behaviors were collected and systematically scrutinized, 
revealing distinct patterns and behaviors across varying frequency ranges. 
Notably, the differentiator circuit demonstrated a distinct phase transition at a specific frequency, whereas the integrator circuit displayed a more gradual phase shift. \\	
These findings offer invaluable insights into harnessing these circuits for a variety of signal processing tasks, underscoring their significance in modern electronic systems.
