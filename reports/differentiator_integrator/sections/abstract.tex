In the realm of electronics and signal processing, a profound understanding of circuit behavior is paramount for designing high-efficiency systems. 
The primary objective of this experiment was to delve into the intricacies of differentiator and integrator circuits, shedding light on their frequency responses.
To achieve this, custom-tailored circuits were meticulously constructed to fulfill the distinct roles of measuring rate of change and cumulative input. 
Through comprehensive frequency sweeps that encompassed a spectrum from low to high frequencies, intricate data regarding gain and phase behaviors were collected and systematically scrutinized, 
revealing distinct patterns and behaviors across different frequency ranges.
